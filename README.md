This documentation provides information about the PandaDoc bot project that was initiated on 19th January.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to automate the document creation process on PandaDoc, substituting Zapier

## Problem Statement
When Zapier is used for generating documents, PandaDoc charges additional volume-based charges. Since PandaDoc is charging extra costs for creating documents through Zapier, we aim to mimic a real human to do this process so that we don’t need access to the PandaDoc API and can avoid the extra costs.

Considering the estimated usage (5,000 docs per year) that would mean, for a 1 year contract:

- $6,588 ($6,000 or 1,020% increase over the annual pricing initially agreed upon for the same services)

## Scope 

10 documents that need to be automated

✅ Promissory Letter

✅ Cap resure

✅ Asse rules and regulations

6 different Checklists

* Pre-arrival orientation [needs a Candidate field]

## Installation Process

Type on your terminal

```console
npx playwright install
```

Then, auth.json document must be generated (add how) or use the private one for the company - request access

Create .env file with the passwords or use the private one for the company - request access 

run tests 🙌🏼
